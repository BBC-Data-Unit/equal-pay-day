On November 10 - the day that campaigners highlight a woman on an average wage stops being paid relative to their male counterparts - we published a special feature allowing users to "Find out what the gender pay gap is in your area".

## Statistical context: mean vs median average

Depending on whether you use a mean average or a median average, the pay gap can be either 14% or 9%. Our story included an analysis by Robert Cuffe, BBC News Head of Statistics explaining the choice to use a mean average. He said: 

> "Both [averages] come from the Office for National Statistics. They use different averages. The 9% figure uses the middle (median) number. The 14% figure uses the mean average. The mean can be pushed up by very a small number of high values. If Bill Gates walks into your local pub, the mean wealth there will shoot up by millions, but the median won't change much.

> "The ONS prefer 9% for that reason but campaigners say that the average should reflect the gaps across all of society.

> "Whether equal pay day lands on 10 November (mean), 27 November (median) or on a different day in your area, this analysis shows that there are few places in the UK where it lands on 31 December."
